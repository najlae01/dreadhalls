# Dreadhalls - Horror FPS Maze Game

Welcome to Dreadhalls, a scary first-person maze game created as part of the CS50 Introduction to Game Development course using Unity.

## Gameplay

Dreadhalls puts you in a spooky maze full of dark corridors, dangerous holes in the floor, and creepy sounds. Your job is to explore the maze, find the pickup coin to move to the next level, and survive the scary stuff hiding in the shadows. Be careful not to fall through any holes, or it's game over!

## Features

- **Random Mazes:** Every time you play, the maze changes, giving you a new challenge with different holes and obstacles.
- **Level Up:** Find the pickup coin to level up and face even tougher mazes.
- **Game Over:** Falling through a hole means you lose the game and have to start over.
- **Level Counter:** Keep track of your progress as you collect coins and advance through the levels.

## How to Play

1. Use the WASD keys or arrow keys to move around the maze.
2. Look out for the pickup coin to move to the next level.
3. Watch your step! Falling through a hole ends the game.
4. Stay alert and brave the darkness to survive.
